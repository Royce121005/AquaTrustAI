# Phase 14 — Controlled Architecture Comparison

## Status
NOT STARTED

## Phase objective
Implement the experimental harness required to compare centralized, blockchain-centric and hybrid architectures under controlled conditions.

## Previous-phase dependency
13

This phase is governed by all MASTER documents. The phase file does not override the master specification.

2. `MASTER/ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md`
3. `MASTER/DATA_CONTRACTS.md`

## Scope
Implement the experimental harness required to compare centralized, blockchain-centric and hybrid architectures under controlled conditions.

## Explicitly out of scope
Do not mix production application logic with benchmark harness logic. Do not change workloads between architectures without recording the difference.

## Implementation requirements
Experiment configurations, identical workload generation, architecture adapters, measurement collection, repeated trials, result storage/export and methodology documentation.

## Required pre-change audit

Before editing:
- inspect the current repository;
- inspect relevant existing files;
- identify already-implemented functionality;
- identify previous-phase contracts;
- identify callers/dependents of files being changed;
- identify tests covering affected behavior;
- record any discrepancy between documentation and implementation.

## Database requirements
Any schema change must:
- use the repository's migration mechanism;
- avoid destructive changes unless explicitly approved;
- include migration tests or validation;
- document affected tables/indexes/constraints.

If this phase does not require database changes, state that explicitly in the completion report.

## API requirements
Any API change must document:
- endpoint;
- method;
- request;
- response;
- errors;
- authentication/authorization;
- consumers;
- compatibility impact.

## Integration requirements

The phase must integrate with all frozen predecessor functionality. Do not create a parallel implementation of an existing responsibility.

## Testing requirements

At minimum, add or update applicable:
- unit tests;
- integration tests;
- negative/error-path tests;
- regression tests.

Run the repository's relevant build/lint/type-check/test commands.

## Exit criteria

Each architecture can execute the same defined experiment scenario and produces comparable measurements with documented conditions.

Additionally:
- no fake production behavior;
- no undocumented contract changes;
- no known critical regression;
- no future-phase implementation hidden inside this phase.

## Required completion report

Create/update:

`COMPLETION/PHASE_14_REPORT.md`

using `TEMPLATES/PHASE_COMPLETION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Stop condition

Do not begin Phase 15. The next phase must be started as a separate execution task after this phase is reviewed/frozen.

## Contract freeze requirement

Before implementation, confirm that the assigned work does not require changing a frozen contract. If it does, stop and follow `MASTER/CHANGE_CONTROL.md`; do not silently reinterpret the contract.
